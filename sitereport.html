               <h2 class="Topic">My Experience Of Learning The Basics Of Web Development</h2>
               <p  class="paragraph">
                    The first phase of learning any new skill is always complicated and to tackle this step requires a lot of determination. Web Development was same for me.<br> 
                    <br>
                    Namaste, I am Aayush Dahal, and I am sharing my experience of learning web development.<br> 

                    <br>

                    The first step was to master some basic understanding of web development.The basics are always the most important concepts that should be clear and understood precisely. Coding, debugging and design is not that simple,it needs a lot of time and a lot of effort.I can tell it was a big challange for me.It was frustrating at the beginning.I used to work on the program for hours and was so excited to run it for the first time and try it out. 
                    but the program didn't run.Then I had to go back and read it again to find the mistake I made. semicolon was missing.
                    With constant learning, I went through the provided slides and did some research on the internet as well. In this short study, I have learned many lessons from those ups and downs, and these lessons could be useful in the days to come.<br>
                    <br>
                    I want to express my sincere gratitude for the efforts that our module teacher (Ankit Thapa) took for us and helped us grow.<br>
                    Now, I feel very comfortable, It's fun learning this module.

                    </h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                    When I first received this assignment, I was very interested in it. 
                    Developing this portfolio website is my first web development experience. In the beginning, I encountered many difficulties in the design and the selection of colors. I tried using my own layout and design to show skills, but due to unsatisfactory results I worked overtime and changed it. The different changes to the layout, style, and color selection of the web page, is one of my best experiences in learning to make different labels, layouts, and styles.
